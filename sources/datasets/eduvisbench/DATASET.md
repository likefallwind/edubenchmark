# EduVisBench Dataset

## Overview

The EduVisBench dataset is a comprehensive collection of educational questions designed to benchmark and evaluate pedagogical visualizations. It is curated from a variety of high-quality sources, covering multiple subjects and difficulty levels to provide a robust testbed for educational content generation systems like EduVisAgent.

The dataset is structured to support the evaluation of generated visualizations across five key dimensions as outlined in our paper, "From EduVisBench to EduVisAgent: A Benchmark and Multi-Agent Framework for Pedagogical Visualization."

## Data Structure

The core of the dataset is `evaluation/data/data.json`, a JSON file containing a list of questions. Each question is represented as a JSON object with the following fields:

-   `subject` (string): The academic subject of the question (e.g., `chemistry`, `physics`, `maths`).
-   `data_source` (string): The original source of the question (e.g., `AI4Chem/C-MHChem-Benchmark-Chinese-Middle-high-school-Chemistry-Test`).
-   `id` (integer): A unique identifier for the question.
-   `difficulty` (string): The difficulty level of the question (e.g., `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `difficult`). Some entries may use `Image` or `Text` to denote the format.
-   `question` (string): The full text of the question.
